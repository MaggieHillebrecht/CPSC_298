## V0 Generated Front-End App

I wanted to use V0 to create something relevant in my minor. So I through of a video game idea and asked it to create a front page for it.

+ "I want to make a page for an upcoming cozy game revolving around a cat and a dog fighting crime in their owners backyard. I want there to be a small description of the game and a store front for two purchase options, one for the base game and one for the creators edition"

I saw that V0 offers a limited range of free themes, so I decide to go with one that I felt fit the description of the game I would be advertising. 

Although the website felt a bit bland, it still gave me a great starting point to go off of. As someone who would see this game being more for indie studios, the simplicity of the website shows that.

As someone who created their portfolio with Vercel this summer, V0 seems like a nobrainer creation. I think for the average person who isn't super interested in coding or maybe doesn't have time to create a concept website, v0 is great.

### Additionally
When trying to figure out the pull request mechanic and how exactly this assignment was suppose to be presented. I tried going back to the page I generated last week and V0 has been updated. It doesn't show my previous page, but had me generate a new one.

* The page changed slightly and I was no longer able to pick a theme
One of the main differences between the two pages was that the new one had more elements added. A dog and cat icon, as well as a catch phrase that said "Get your paws on it!". The other major difference was that it only gave me the landing page code. Previously it gave me 4 scripts that would help with back-end work. Thus, me adding the LandingPage file has so many errors as it is deriving from scripts that aren't existing.
